# Linear Regression on Medical Charges - An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, we walked through a comprehensive machine learning workflow to predict medical charges using linear regression in Python. Our models yielded valuable insights, but also surfaced limitations and opportunities for improvement.

## Key Findings
Our final model achieved an RMSE of ~5900 on the test set. This means on average, predictions were off by $5900 - decent but clearly room for improvement.
Using one-hot encoding for categorical features like smoker status reduced the loss substantially, by almost 50%. This highlights the critical importance of encoding categoricals properly.
Of the numeric features, age and BMI had the highest correlation with charges, which was reflected in their weights. This aligns with domain knowledge about their impact on health.
Charges varied significantly by region, but differences were not consistent across states. This suggests complex regional dynamics at play.
Visual analysis revealed clusters and outliers. A small fraction of patients incurred very high expenses, skewing distributions.
## Key Limitations
The gap between training and test performance indicates overfitting. Regularization techniques could help.
Remaining error shows linear regression has limits. Non-linear models like random forests may better capture interactions.
Hard to visualize relationships between multiple features. Advanced techniques like PCA could derive better inputs.
Dataset is limited in size and diversity. More varied data could improve generalizability.
## Next Steps
Try regularized versions like Lasso, Ridge or ElasticNet to reduce overfitting.
Experiment with non-linear models like random forests, XGBoost or neural networks.
Derive better feature representations through PCA, polynomial transforms etc.
Create more extensive datasets by merging multiple sources.
By thoroughly analyzing these results, we've developed a detailed understanding of the challenges and opportunities. Implementing some of the next steps could significantly boost model performance.
